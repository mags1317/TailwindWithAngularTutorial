# Lesson 1: Introduction to Tailwind CSS

**Duration:** 10 minutes

## Overview

In this lesson, we'll introduce the basics of Tailwind CSS and discuss why it's a valuable tool for front-end development.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS offers a set of utility classes that you can apply directly to your HTML elements to create custom designs quickly.

## Why is Tailwind CSS Useful?

Tailwind CSS offers several advantages over traditional CSS frameworks:

1. **Utility-First Approach**: Tailwind CSS promotes a utility-first approach, where you apply small utility classes directly to your HTML elements to style them. This approach provides greater flexibility and allows you to create custom designs without writing custom CSS.

2. **Configurability**: Tailwind CSS is highly configurable. You can customize the framework's default theme, add new utility classes, or override existing ones to fit your project's specific design requirements.

3. **Flexibility**: With Tailwind CSS, you're not limited to a predefined set of styles. Instead, you have complete control over every aspect of your design, allowing you to create unique and responsive layouts tailored to your needs.

In the next section, we'll dive deeper into the core principles of Tailwind CSS and explore how to get started with the framework.
